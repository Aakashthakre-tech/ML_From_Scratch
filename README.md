# ML_From_Scratch
Implementation of core Machine Learning algorithms — Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) — built completely from scratch using Python and NumPy, without using scikit-learn. This project focuses on understanding mathematical foundations, optimization techniques, and algorithmic implementation.
